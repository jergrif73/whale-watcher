## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Verify secrets are set correctly in GitHub
2. Ensure you're using a Google App Password, not your regular password
3. Check the Actions log for error messages

### Dashboard Not Updating

1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled
2. Check that the workflow completed successfully
3. Data updates every hour on schedule

### No Portfolio Data

1. Ensure at least one ticker has `entry > 0`
2. Check that the date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Run the workflow manually to see debug output

### "GitHub API error: 401" when logging a trade

The dashboard commits trades by calling the GitHub API from your browser using a Personal Access Token saved in `localStorage`. A 401 means that token is invalid, expired, or revoked.

1. Open the dashboard → click ⚙️ Settings
2. Click **Clear Token**
3. Generate a new PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new with **repo** scope
4. Paste it into the Settings token field
5. Click **Test Token** to verify it authenticates (you should see `✅ Valid — authenticated as <your-login>`)
6. Click **Save** and retry the trade
